[] A client sends an action to the server.
[] The server hands the action to the Redux Store.
[] The Store calls the reducer and the reducer executes the logic related to the action.
[] The Store updates its state based on the return value of the reducer.
[] The Store executes the listener function subscribed by the server.
[] The server emits a 'state' event.
[] All connected clients - including the one that initiated the original action - receive the new state.
